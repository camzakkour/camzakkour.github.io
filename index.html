          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>When I got into Cal State Fullerton, I was a passionate and devoted Kinesiology major. After a few years of learning more about the health field, I found that it wasn't truly what I had expected it to be like, and I started losing this love I had for Kinesiology. While still in school, I discovered computer science from a few peers who showed me the possibilities that computer science has. I soon came to realization that these possibilities are endless and this was a route I was more driven to follow.

           I am now a driven software developer, with only a few months of coding experience but always willing to learn more about new coding languages in technologies.</p>
